## Project Description
DoorstepDining is a web application dedicated to delivering mouthwatering meals from local restaurants directly to your doorstep. We aim to simplify the dining experience, providing you with a user-friendly platform to order food effortlessly while supporting local eateries.

### Key Features
- **Seamless Ordering:** Browse local restaurant menus, place orders, and enjoy your favorite meals without leaving your home.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Our algorithm suggests food choices tailored to your preferences, enhancing your dining experience.
- **Real-Time Order Tracking:** Keep track of your order in real-time and receive accurate notifications about its status.
- **Secure Payment Processing:** We offer secure and convenient payment options, including popular local methods like M-Pesa.

## Technologies Used
DoorstepDining utilizes a range of cutting-edge technologies to provide a seamless food delivery experience:

### Front-end
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (React.js)

React.js simplifies building user interfaces by using reusable components. Its virtual DOM enhances performance by minimizing page updates.

### Back-end
- Node.js
- Express.js

Node.js is known for its speed and scalability, making it an excellent choice for building server-side applications. Express.js streamlines routing, middleware management, and handling HTTP requests, reducing development time.

### Database
- MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that offers flexibility and scalability. Its document-oriented structure allows us to store and retrieve data in a JSON-like format, aligning perfectly with JavaScript and making it easy to work with.

### Deployment
- Heroku

Heroku offers a free tier for small-scale projects, making it cost-effective for startups and developers.

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Payment Gateway:** Secure and Convenient Payment Processing
  We integrate local payment options widely used in Kenya, such as M-Pesa and various mobile banking apps, to cater to the preferences of our Kenyan user base.

- **Mapping Service:** Google Maps API for Location-Based Feature
  Accurate location services are crucial for a food delivery application, especially in Kenya's diverse urban and rural areas. We ensure that the Google Maps integration is tailored to the unique geographical and logistical challenges of Kenya, including addressing rural areas and diverse terrain.
